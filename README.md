This project demonstrates how Linked Lists work. Linked Lists differ from regular lists by instead of taking up a fixed row of memory, each node has a reference to another nodes address. These memory locations don't need to be in one row they can all be scattered into different memory rows as long as they are connected by a reference. Though a regular Linked List does not allow you to iterate in both direction of left or right. You can only move right as we don't have another reference to the one before. Though this can be done by using other Linked Lists such as Doubly Linked Lists this one only focuses on Singly Linked List.
